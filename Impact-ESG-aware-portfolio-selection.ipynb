    "# Sustainable Portfolio Selection: An Approach to Impact Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In our article [Sustainable Portfolio Selection -- Markowitz goes ESG](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/SustainablePortfolioSelection) we describe the importance of ecological, social and governance (ESG) aspects of financial services and give a first approach, how ESG measures can be included into portfolio selection strategies.  Basically, ESG-ratings of financial instruments, like for instance Refinitiv's ESG Scores, can be mathematically treated similar to mean historical returns. As a result, one can balance estimates for risk and/or return with ESG-ratings and compute portfolios of financial instruments with high average ESG Score as well as good risk measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this follow-up article we adhere to the fact that high ESG-ratings can have a different impact in different industrial sectors or countries. We will show, how impact data can be integrated into portfolio selection models with ESG-awareness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you can learn \n",
    " * to get business sector information from Refinitiv and to plot the sector distribution of a weighted portfolio;\n",
    " * how to balance volatility as a risk measure with portfolio returns and ESG-measures in portfolio selection;\n",
    " * about the basics of impact modeling, and how sector impact information can be included into portfolio selection. \n",
    " \n",
    "We build on the steps in [Sustainable Portfolio Selection -- Markowitz goes ESG](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/SustainablePortfolioSelection), where basically a classical Markowitz model is employed, but returns are replaced by ESG-ratings. This tutorial is structured as follows: \n",
    " * **Step 1** Get data via eikon, prepare the basic data structures. \n",
    " * **Step 2** Build the minimum volatility portfolio (MVP) and analyze its business sector distribution.\n",
    " * **Step 3** Build a portfolio, where volatility is balanced with return and also the *ESG-score*. \n",
    " * **Step 4** Build a model for impact-ESG and utilize it to select a portfolio, where volatility is balanced with return and the *impact-ESG-score*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    " * Refinitiv Eikon / Workspace with access to Eikon Data APIs (Free Trial Available)\n",
    " * Python 3.x\n",
    " * Required Python Packages: eikon, pandas 0.17.0 or higher, numpy, random, scipy, matplotlib, os\n"

    "The idea behind impact investment is to invest specifically in companies that have a positive impact on social or environmental goals. Depending on the location or on the sector of economic activities, a high ESG Score can have a different impact -- for instance, a company that cares for clean drinking water has more impact in countries where clean water is actually an issue. Or using only renewable energies has much more impact in energy intense business sectors. We leave an evaluation of this kind of impact to experts in the field, and show here, how impact expertise can be included into our portfolio selection model.  \n",

    "We assume that wise people provide a score between 0 and 10 for each of the sectors covered by our universe. The score 0 means that an ESG-Rating exceeding the lower bound of 70 has no impact in this sector, whereas the score 10 implies a high impact of extra ESG points. To keep our example simple and illustrative, we just select one sector (construction of buildings, no. 41) which has the impact 10, and assume that all others have the impact 0 (for whatever reason). This impact information is assumed to be given by experts in a dictionary **nace_dict** with 2 digit NACE codes as keys and the respective impact score as values. \n",

    "We hope that we could show, how different aspects and criteria can be considered in a portfolio selection strategy. We have constructed 3 portfolios: All of them satisfy a lower bound on the ESG-score in every constituent. By using specific objective functions in the minimization problem, we could steer the distribution of the investment to have low volatility in the first one, and a trade-of between low volatility but also high returns and high ESG-scores in the second one. For the third portfolio, we showed a model for impact-ESG scores and included it into the optimization goal. \n",

    "This tutorial aims to show some key techniques and thus scratches only the surface of ESG- and risk-aware portfolio selection. One can refine the models in many aspects, and one could go for more details in the analysis of the results. We refer to the literature and to the large pool of Refinitiv tutorials in the developers' community. "
